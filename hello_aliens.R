cat("Hello Aliens! \n
I wonder how life on your planet is like, and hopefully we will be able to meet one day.\n
Although there are many problems with life on Earth, in general it is pretty good. \n
If you ever come visit, make sure you see the fabulous creatures known as dogs. They are \n
definitely friendlier and cuter than most human beings. Also make sure to tour all the countries \n
and cultures around the world. What's life on your planet like? Is it also divided into many countries? \n
There are a lot of humans (7.5 billion in fact). How many people are there on your planet? 
Enjoy your trip on Earth if you ever come! :) \n")
